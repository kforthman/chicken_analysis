## This version of the task was created way before the MTurk version so there are numerous things that differ.

(1) This is the prediction version so subjects are asked to choose which chicken will lay the next egg.

(2) The chickens are further apart so there is less overlap. 
	Left Chicken Position is (x=-342, y=0), 
	Right Chicken Position is (x=342, y=0)
	Block definitions are as follows:
	Block 1 -> Hrate=0.05, Sigma=150
	Block 2 -> Hate=0.05, Sigma=200
	Block 3 -> Hrate=0.2, Sigma=150
	Block 4 -> Hrate=0.2, Sigma=200
	Block 5 -> Hrate=0.95, Sigma=150
	Block 6 -> Hrate=0.95, Sigma=200

(3) Feedback is given every trial (there is a bar at the top showing their points progress but not the actual points)

(4) Each subject gets either of the 3 patterns randomly. That pattern is the same for T1 and T2.
The different patterns are just the different ordering of the blocks.

Pattern 1: (http://brainworkout.paulus.libr.net/?task=chicken&pattern=1) ->  table134.txt
Pattern 2: (http://brainworkout.paulus.libr.net/?task=chicken&pattern=2) -> table145.txt
Pattern 3: (http://brainworkout.paulus.libr.net/?task=chicken&pattern=3) -> table4.txt
